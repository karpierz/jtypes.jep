jtypes.jep
==========

Java Embedded Python.

Overview
========

  | jtypes.jep embeds CPython in Java.
  | It is safe to use in a heavily threaded environment.
  |
  | jtypes.jep is a lightweight Python package, based on the ctypes FFI library.
  | It is an almost fully compliant implementation of Mike Johnson's Jep package
    by reimplementing its functionality in a clean Python instead of C.

About Jep:
----------

Borrowed from the `original website <https://github.com/ninia/jep/>`__:

  Jep embeds CPython in Java through JNI and is safe to use in a heavily
  threaded environment. 

  Some benefits of embedding CPython in a JVM:

  * Using the native Python interpreter may be much faster than alternatives.
  * Python is mature, well supported, and well documented.
  * Access to high quality Python modules, both native CPython extensions and
    Python-based.
  * Compilers and assorted Python tools are as mature as the language.
  * Python is an interpreted language, enabling scripting of established
    Java code without requiring recompilation.
  * Both Java and Python are cross platform, enabling deployment to different
    operating systems.

  Notable features

  * Interactive Jep console much like Python's interactive console
  * Supports multiple, simultaneous, mostly sandboxed sub-interpreters
  * Numpy support for Java primitive arrays
